# Aerospace Engineering Airfoil Project
This project was for my Honors Aerospace Engineering Class. We were tasked with designing an airfoil for three different situations of flight. First: takeoff at sea level. Second: Takeoff at Denver (4500ft). Last: Level Flight at Cruising Altitude. We used primarily NASA's Foil Sim software to design the airfoil by changing the camber, angle of attack, and chord length values. We then calculated the different lift forces produced by the airfoils at different speeds and altitudes. Finally, we made a physical airfoil for one of the scenarios and tested it in the wind tunnel to compare the data with our calculations.
